# Hi, I'm Luai 👋

I'm a passionate **Front-End Developer** focused on building interactive and user-friendly web applications using **React**, **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**.

I started learning programming through online tutorials and practical projects. I believe in consistent learning by building and practicing real-world examples — and I'm always looking to improve and challenge myself more.

- ✅ Started with HTML & CSS (14+ hours of basic tutorials)
- ✅ Moved to JavaScript (9+ hours of fundamentals + 9 practical project tutorials)
